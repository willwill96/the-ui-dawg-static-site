description: Project to Integrate Petfinder & Graphql
---

In this project, I provide a wrapper GraphQL wrapper the Petfinder API. The code is built on [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) & [apollo-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server) and is built as express middleware. The project can be used as an npm package that provides a middleware function or as a standalone docker image.
