If you've been developing npm packages for a while, and use build tools like typescript before publishing to an npm registry, you probably know that sometimes your packages behave differently after being built.

There are tools available like `npm/yarn/pnpm link` and [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) to help simuate publishing packages in your local environment, but these tools have their own limitations that may make your code behave differently than when published to an npm registry.

For example, most `link` commands have some shortcomings related to symlinks. And yalc has it's own lock file as opposed to integrating directly with your package manager. Wouldn't it be nice if you could truly end-to-end test your npm packages? You can with a service like Verdaccio!

## Verdaccio

The [Verdaccio docs](https://verdaccio.org/) describe it as:

> A lightweight Node.js private proxy registry

Verdaccio is more than just a tool for end-to-end testing. It's an open-source, full fledged npm registry. So, while I'll be going over how to use Verdaccio for end to end testing, there are other use cases like:

- Hosting your own instance(s) as a private registry for your organization
- Hosting locally for installing npm packages while offline

## Getting started

### Docker Container Setup

The easiest way to get started with Verdaccio in my opinion, is to use their docker image:

```sh
docker pull verdaccio/verdaccio

docker run -it --rm --name verdaccio -p 4873:4873 verdaccio/verdaccio
```

Next, let's set up a user so that we can login to the npm registry:

```sh
npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873
```

Once you've created your user you should be able to checkout the Verdaccio UI at `http://localhost:4873`!

### Installing Packages from Verdaccio

Before we publish a package we need to create one. If you've already got a package in mind, you can skip this step.

```sh
npm init -y
```

Note: in this example, my package is named `my-test-pkg1`.

Next, we'll configure the project's `.npmrc` to point to the verdaccio npm registry:

```sh
echo "registry=http://localhost:4873" > .npmrc
# OR if you want to configure this globally
echo "registry=http://localhost:4873" > ~/.npmrc
# OR if you only want to use the verdaccio npm registry for specific scoped packages
echo "@myscope:registry=http://localhost:4873" > .npmrc
```

Now that we're directing our npm registry to our local verdaccio instance, let's try installing a package.

```sh
npm install -D typescript
```

If we take a look at the project's `package-lock.json` after this, you should see the resolved url to be pointing to our locally running instance:

<img src={convertToBaseUrl("verdaccio/verdaccio-install.png")} />

If you're following along, or just looked at the previous screenshot you might have noticed that there were no packages published to verdaccio. So where did this package come from? Verdaccio supports a concept known as [uplinks](https://verdaccio.org/docs/uplinks/).

From verdaccio docs:

> An uplink is a link with an external registry that provides access to external packages.

I like to think of an uplink as a way of aggregating packages across multiple registries while serving them all from a single registry. By default, Verdaccio contains an uplink for the public npm registry (`registry.npmjs.org`), which is where `typescript` is being pulled from. This allows you to easily pull your private packages & public packages from the same registry.

Let's do a few more things to make sure our package is ready for publish:

1. Create a `tsconfig.json` by running `tsc --init`. If needed, make configurations as necesary. In this example, I have the following `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Visit https://aka.ms/tsconfig to read more about this file */

    /* Projects */
    "target": "es2016" /* Set the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript and include compatible library declarations. */,

    /* Modules */
    "module": "commonjs" /* Specify what module code is generated. */,
    "rootDir": "./src/" /* Specify the root folder within your source files. */,
    "outDir": "./dist" /* Specify an output folder for all emitted files. */,
    "esModuleInterop": true /* Emit additional JavaScript to ease support for importing CommonJS modules. This enables 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports' for type compatibility. */,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true /* Ensure that casing is correct in imports. */,

    /* Type Checking */
    "strict": true /* Enable all strict type-checking options. */,
    "skipLibCheck": true /* Skip type checking all .d.ts files. */
  }
}
```

2. Update the `package.json` to have a typescript build step & to point to the correct compiled files.

```json
{
  "name": "my-test-pkg1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "files": ["dist/"],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.4"
  }
}
```

### Publishing Your First Package to Verdaccio

Next, we need to actually create some code that we want to publish.

For the purposes of keeping this blog post simple and focused on e2e testing, we will create a very simple function that we want to package:

```ts
// src/index.ts
export function identity(myParam: any) {
  return myParam;
}
```

Now you should be ready to publish your package:

```sh
npm publish
```

After running, you should see some output similar to following:

```
> my-test-pkg1@1.0.0 prepublishOnly
> npm run build


> my-test-pkg1@1.0.0 prebuild
> rm -rf dist/


> my-test-pkg1@1.0.0 build
> tsc

```

Congratulations, you've just published your first package to Verdaccio! But what about testing that functionality?

## Testing Your Packages

### Locally

To test this functionality, we'll set up a new project where we intend to install the package. Setup for this package is identical to how we set up the published package, but we can stop once the `.npmrc` is set up.

Next let's `cd` into the new package's directory and install our published package:

```sh
npm i my-test-pkg1
```

Now, that the package is installed, let's create a short script to verify the function is working as intended:

```js
// index.js
const { identity } = require("my-test-pkg1");

console.log(identity("Foo Bar"));
```

If everything is working as expected, you should be able to run this script successfully with:

```sh
node index.js
```

This is pretty cool, but wouldn't it be much better if we could run automated test suites to test this functionality?

I think that the easiest way to incorporate a test suite in your project these days is to add [vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

Note: If you already have a testing suite set up, you can skip to the next section.

```
npm i -D vitest
```

Next, create a boilerplate `vitest.config.ts` file:

```ts
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {},
});
```

Next, let's create a simple unit test for our published package using vitest:

```ts
// test/my-test-pkg1.spec.ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
const { identity } = require("my-test-pkg1");

describe("my-test-pkg1", () => {
  it("returns the correct value", () => {
    expect(identity("Foo Bar")).toEqual("Foo Bar");
  });
});
```

Finally, let's add a script to the `package.json` so we can easily run the test suite:

```json
...
   "scripts: {
    ...
    "test": "vitest run",
    ...
   }
```

Now you should be able to run your automated test suite with `npm run test` & see something similar to the following:

<img src={convertToBaseUrl("verdaccio/verdaccio-vitest.png")} />

### Testing as a CI job

If you've setup CI jobs before, you may already have an idea of how to run the test suite. The tricky part ends up being standing up the verdaccio instance and getting your package published from the CI environment.

Luckily, Github Actions allows you to provide a `services` definition to your jobs, which allows you to [run containerized services alongside your jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services).

For example you may have the following in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e-test:
    services:
      verdaccio-instance:
        image: verdaccio/verdaccio
        ports:
          - 4873:4873
```

The above snippet is simply saying to run the verdaccio docker image as part of the `e2e-test` job. We forward the port that verdaccio runs on so we can access it from the job.

From here, you should be able use the verdaccio instance for both installing & publishing packages from your CI job. For a full example of a job specification, see below:

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e-test:
    services:
      verdaccio-instance:
        image: verdaccio/verdaccio
        ports:
          - 4873:4873
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js 20
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: "npm"
        # Setup verdaccio as the default npm registry
      - run: echo "registry=http://localhost:4873" > ~/.npmrc
      - name: Publish Package
        run: |
          {
            cd verdaccio-test
            npm version 1.0.0-test-ci --git-tag-version=false
            npm ci
            npx npm-cli-login -u test -p 1234 -e test@domain.test -r http://localhost:4873
            npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873
          }
      - name: "Test published package"
        run: |
          {
            cd verdaccio-test-install
            npm install
            npm install my-test-pkg1@1.0.0-test-ci
            npm run test
          }
```

## Closing Thoughts

While this setup may not be necessary for every project, I think that Verdaccio provides a superior service to alternatives like `npm link` & `yalc`, due to simulateneously being a full-fledged npm registry as well and providing an ephemeral environment that can be recreated simply with a docker image. I hope this article was useful for you in getting started with e2e testing npm packages. Happy Coding!
